    <h6>Bruschetta with a classic balsamic glaze</h6>
    <p>Bruschetta is a classic Italian appetizer that consists of grilled or toasted bread 
        that is rubbed with garlic and drizzled with olive oil. 
        It is typically topped with fresh tomato, basil, and mozzarella cheese,
         and sometimes with other ingredients such as balsamic vinegar, parmesan cheese, 
         or prosciutto. The combination of the crunchy bread, juicy tomatoes, fresh basil, 
         and melted cheese creates a flavorful and satisfying bite. 
         Bruschetta is easy to make and is perfect for serving at a dinner party, as a snack, or as a light meal.</p>
